1. Introduction
	What is the project about? 
        Why is this an important research question? 
        Which are our objectives?
        How will we try to achivie them?
2. Literature Review
        Explanation of the methods we will use.
            Why/how they work? (from where we start to explain???) (i.e. if I want to explain a Fully Conected should I talk first about CNN?)
            Why  we use them istead of others

3. Methodology
        Explanation how we implemented the methods. Validation metrics we use, how we tune paramaters,etc

4. Discussion of Results

5. Conclusions

6. References 

7. Appendix (for example, Description of Datasets; code)

2 Possible ways to approach the project:
        
    COMMUN PART:
        * Use Bea's code with weights already trained to segmentate our data. 
            * Validation using dataset patients
        * Use Bea's code to train the network with only 2 labels.
	* Classificar placa-> lipids, calci... Nova xarxa.
    
    OPTION 1:
        * Research for other state of the art methods and try to implement them. Compare the results.
    
    OPTION 2:
        * Cross the segmentated data with the patients data to exctract conclusions.
            --> Predict death?
            --> Predict future state of the placa?
            --> Search for factors correlated to the placa state??
